## Running the code

Load SerialEmotionTest and SerialEmotionTestBonBon2 onto 2 different ESP32's. Connect a raspberry pi to both of them and run the appropriate python script.

Run 1bon.py if there is only 1 bonbon. This bonbon should be connected via a serial port on /dev/rfcomm0.

Run 2bon.py if there are 2 bonbons. One bonbon should be connected on serial port /dev/rfcomm0, and another on /dev/rfcomm1. See "bluetooth/bluetoothDoc.md" for more information.
